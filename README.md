I am a game development enthusiast, and I thought it would be interesting to program a game using Java based on the knowledge I acquired in my Fundamentals of Programming subject.

## This is a project about a game that utilizes the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming. I have created a game that involves two players competing against each other. In the game, players can select their vocation based on specific advantages and disadvantages.

⚔️ - You will accept the challenge?
